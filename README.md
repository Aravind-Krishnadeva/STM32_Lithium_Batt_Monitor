### Goal of the project
To build a basic lithium battery monitoring system using STM32 (e.g., Nucleo board) that measures:
1. Voltage
2. Current
3. Logs and displays data (serial/LED/LCD)
4. Sets foundation for AI-powered SoC/SoH estimation later

## Functional Requirements
- [x] Measure battery voltage via ADC
- [x] Measure current using ACS712
- [ ] Estimate battery state of charge
- [ ] Log data to serial
- [ ] Add low-battery warning
